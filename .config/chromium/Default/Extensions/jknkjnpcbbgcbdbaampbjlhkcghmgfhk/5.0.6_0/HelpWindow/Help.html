					<strong>What does this extension do?</strong><br>
					This extension allows you to hide videos on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">www.youtube.com</a> from certain channels. These channels can be selected by yourself.
		 		</p>
		 		<p>
					<strong>How do I specify the channels whose videos I want to hide?</strong><br>
					<small><i>Option 1:</i></small>
					Right-click on a link to a video on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">www.youtube.com</a> (e.g. on the home page or in the side bar) and choose 'Block videos from X'. If it says that no channel name could be found, try right-clicking somewhere else.<br>
					<small><i>Option 2:</i></small>
					When visiting <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">www.youtube.com</a>, click on the icon in the address bar. You can type in the name of the channel you want to block by clicking on the <i class="fa fa-plus-square-o"></i> button. Everything you enter is case-sensitive, so videos from a channel named 'MyBlockedChannel' will not be hidden when you add 'myblockedchannel'.
		 		</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Can I block multiple channels by using a wildcard?</strong><br>
					Yes, by using option 2 from the previous question to block a channel, you can change 'channel' to 'wildcard' before adding it to the list. Your input will then be saved as a wildcard and will hide videos from every channel that has the wildcard in their channel name. Everything is case-sensitive, so videos from a channel named 'ChannelWEWO' or 'Channel2WEWO' will not be hidden when you add 'wewo'.
		 		</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Can I block videos not by a channel but by a keyword in the title?</strong><br>
					Yes, by using option 2 from the previous question to block a channel, you can change 'channel' to 'keyword' before adding it to the list. Your input will then be saved as a keyword and will hide videos with that keyword in the title. Keywords are not case-sensitive.
		 		</p>
		 		<p>
					<strong>Where can I see which channels, wildcards and keywords I have added?</strong><br>
					When visiting <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">www.youtube.com</a>, click on the icon in the address bar. Here you can see which channels are being blocked right now.
		 		</p>
		 		<p>
					<strong>How do I unblock a channel?</strong><br>
					When visiting <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">www.youtube.com</a>, click on the icon in the address bar. To delete a channel, wildcard or keyword from the list, click on the item you want to remove from the list, then click on 'Unblock'. If you want to delete all channels, wildcards and keywords from the list at once, click on the <i class="fa fa-trash"></i> button.
		 		</p>
		 		<p>
					<strong>Can I export my blocked channels to a file?</strong><br>
					Yes, when visiting <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">www.youtube.com</a>, click on the icon in the address bar. To export the list of blocked channels and wildcards to a file, click the <i class="fa fa-save"></i> button. A .csv file will be downloaded to your computer, where you can save it as a backup or use it to import on another computer. Importing the downloaded file on another computer is done by clicking the <i class="fa fa-folder-open"></i> button. Please do not import any .csv files other than the exports from this extension, as you might cause unexpected behaviour.
		 		</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Are my blocked channels visible for anyone else than me?</strong><br>
					No, except for anyone who views the list on your computer. Your blocked channels are not sent to any server or whatsoever, they are stored in your own browser.
